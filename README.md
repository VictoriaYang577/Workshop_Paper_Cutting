# Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Folding the Paper

Take one sheet of 20cm x 20cm red paper.

Fold diagonally to form a triangle.

For added symmetry, fold the triangle again.

### Step 2: Drawing the Design

Use a pencil to sketch your chosen design on the folded paper.

Start with simple geometric shapes (hearts, waves) or classic motifs provided in templates.

Beginners are encouraged to start simple and gradually move to complex patterns.

### Step 3: Cutting the Paper

Carefully cut along your drawn lines.

Focus on cutting edges first, then proceed to cut out interior patterns.

Take your time to ensure smooth and clean cuts.

### Step 4: Unfolding the Design

Gently unfold the paper to reveal your symmetrical window flower.

Flatten it carefully to avoid tearing.

### Step 5: Decorating and Attaching

Use glue or tape to attach your finished paper cutting to windows or walls.

Ensure the adhesive is applied gently to prevent damage.

Optionally add glitter or colored paper accents for a festive look.
