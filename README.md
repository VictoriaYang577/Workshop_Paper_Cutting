# Introduction to Paper Cutting

## What is Paper Cutting?

Chinese paper cutting, known as Jianzhi 剪紙, is one of China's most beloved traditional folk arts. It likely dates back to the invention of paper by Cai Lun 蔡倫 during the Eastern Han Dynasty around 105 A.D. As paper became more affordable, paper cutting grew in popularity. Initially, paper cuts were created as offerings to gods, ancestors, and deceased relatives. Over time, they evolved into home decorations, often used on windows and doors. Traditionally, these delicate artworks were glued outside windows, allowing sunlight to shine through and highlight their intricate patterns. Although red paper was commonly used due to its symbolism of happiness and festivity, other colors were also popular. Artists create these designs using scissors or knives, carefully cutting and carving the paper.

The Tang Dynasty marked the golden age of paper cutting, coinciding with a flourishing of poetry. Over forty poems, known as "paper-cutting poems," celebrated the art form. The famous poet Du Fu (712–770) praised paper cutting in his poem "Travelling at Pengya," writing, “暖汤濯我足，翦纸招我魂” (“the warm water washes my feet, and the papercut uplifts my soul”).

Today, paper cutting covers many themes, including animals, characters from Chinese opera, plants, deities, landscapes, and folklore. Symbolism is central to these designs, often representing good luck, happiness, and longevity. The Chinese character "福" symbolizes happiness and fortune, while images of children, lotus flowers, and gourds signify family prosperity. Tortoise patterns stand for longevity, and various birds and animals are common motifs.

Paper cutting styles differ across China. In the North, designs tend to be bold and straightforward, while in the South, they are typically more detailed and delicate. Key centers for paper cutting in Northern China include Hebei, Shanxi, and Shaanxi provinces. In the South, Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces are prominent. This exhibition features paper cuts primarily collected during the 1960s and 1970s from various regions, showcasing the diversity and global influence of this traditional Chinese art form.
